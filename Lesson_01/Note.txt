1.1 First Practice Examples

Example 1:
I observe that the text inside the two pair of brackets won't wrap, even if I type enter.
To make sentence wrap, I have to use another pair of tags.

Example 2: 
I found that the text inside the pairs <b></b> will be bold.
Correspondingly text inside <i></i>, <u></u> will be italicized and underscored.
This means some first letters of some words are used as certain command.

Example 2:
I observe that the sentence inside the pair of brackets has changed its color to blue and is underscored.

Example 3:
We can declare the color in tag.

Example 4:
The color of the enclosed words changed.
