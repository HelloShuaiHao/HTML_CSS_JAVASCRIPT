      <p>of millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, </p>
      <p>linked by a broad arrary of electronics, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet </p>
      <p>carries an extensive range of information resouces and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext </p>
